The project involves helping Arena Hospitality, a hospitality company that has been in the industry for 20 years, to regain its market share and revenue in the luxury/business hotel category. Due to strategic moves from competitors and ineffective decision-making in management, the company is losing its market share and revenue. As a strategic move, the managing director has decided to incorporate "Business and Data Intelligence" to gain insights into their historical data and regain their market share.
As a data analyst, the task is to create metrics, a dashboard, and relevant insights to provide the revenue management team with valuable insights. The team has hired a third-party service provider to provide insights from their historical data. The project involves using sample data and a mock-up dashboard to create metrics according to the metric list, creating a dashboard based on stakeholder requirements, and providing additional insights not included in the metric list or the mock-up dashboard.
The project aims to help Arena Hospitality gain a competitive edge in the luxury/business hotel category by providing valuable insights that can inform decision-making and lead to increased revenue and market share.
